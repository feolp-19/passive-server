## Tips for Maximizing Earnings

1. **Run 24/7** — More uptime = more earnings
2. **Use multiple apps** — They don't compete with each other
3. **Wired connection** — More stable than WiFi
4. **Dedicated hardware** — Old laptop, mini PC, or Raspberry Pi
5. **Be patient** — Some apps take weeks to ramp up
