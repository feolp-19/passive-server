### Step 2: Download & Install

1. Log into your dashboard

### Step 3: Add Your Token

1. Copy your device token from the dashboard
2. Paste it into the app during setup
3. The app will start sharing bandwidth

### Step 4: Set Auto-Start

Make sure it starts with your computer:

**Linux:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.config/autostart/
```

**Docker (recommended for servers):**
```bash
docker run -d --name traffmonetizer traffmonetizer/cli:latest start accept --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Docker Setup (Advanced)

For my Mac Mini server, I use Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name traffmonetizer \
  --restart always \
  traffmonetizer/cli:latest \
  start accept --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

This ensures it always restarts if the system reboots.
