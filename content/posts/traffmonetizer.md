## What is Traffmonetizer?

Traffmonetizer is a bandwidth sharing service that pays you for your unused internet connection. It's similar to Honeygain and Grass but often runs well alongside them.

## Why Add Traffmonetizer?

- ✅ **Stacks with other apps** - Run alongside Grass/Honeygain
- ✅ **$5 signup bonus** with referral
- ✅ **Simple setup** - Download, install, forget
- ✅ **Crypto payouts** - Bitcoin and more
- ✅ **Low resource usage** - Won't slow down your PC

## My Earnings

Running 24/7 on my Mac Mini:

| Month | Earnings |
|-------|----------|
| January 2026 | $4.50 |
| December 2025 | $3.80 |
| November 2025 | $4.20 |

**Average: ~$4/month**

Not the highest, but it's **free money** on top of my other apps!

### Step 2: Download & Install

1. Log into your dashboard
2. Download for your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux/Docker)
3. Install the application

### Step 3: Add Your Token

1. Copy your device token from the dashboard
2. Paste it into the app during setup
3. The app will start sharing bandwidth

### Step 4: Set Auto-Start

Make sure it starts with your computer:

**Linux:**
```bash
# Add to ~/.config/autostart/
```

**Docker (recommended for servers):**
```bash
docker run -d --name traffmonetizer traffmonetizer/cli:latest start accept --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Docker Setup (Advanced)

For my Mac Mini server, I use Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name traffmonetizer \
  --restart always \
  traffmonetizer/cli:latest \
  start accept --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

This ensures it always restarts if the system reboots.
