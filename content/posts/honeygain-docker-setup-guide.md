faq:
  - question: "Is Honeygain safe to use?"
    answer: "Yes. Honeygain only routes public web requests through your connection for market research. They cannot access your personal data, passwords, or private browsing."
  - question: "Can I run Honeygain with other bandwidth apps?"
    answer: "Yes. Running multiple apps (like Grass + Honeygain) on the same server is called app stacking. They don't interfere with each other."
  - question: "What is JumpTask mode in Honeygain?"
    answer: "JumpTask mode pays you in JMPT crypto tokens instead of PayPal. It gives a 10% bonus on all earnings and offers instant payouts."
  - question: "How do I run Honeygain on Linux?"
    answer: "Use Docker. The docker run command lets you run Honeygain headlessly on any Linux server 24/7."

After setting up [Grass](/grass-passive-income-guide/) on my Mac Mini, I realized something obvious:

The server is already running 24/7. Adding a second app costs **$0 extra in electricity**.

This is the core concept of **app stacking** — and it's how you maximize passive income from a single piece of hardware.

Honeygain was my second addition. Here's why it earned that spot.

---

## The App Stacking Strategy

Think about it:

- Your server is already on
- Your internet connection is already paid for
- Most of your bandwidth sits unused

Each passive income app you add uses a tiny slice of those resources. But since the baseline cost is already covered, every additional app is **pure profit**.

My current stack runs 8 apps simultaneously on one old Mac Mini. Honeygain was app #2.

---

## What is Honeygain?

Honeygain is the **OG** of passive income apps. It launched in 2018 and has paid out millions to users worldwide.

### How It Works

You share your unused internet bandwidth. Companies use it for:

- **Market research** — Checking prices across different regions
- **SEO monitoring** — Verifying search rankings from various locations
- **Ad verification** — Ensuring ads display correctly globally
- **Content delivery** — Testing website accessibility

### Is It Safe?

Yes. Honeygain only routes **public web requests** through your connection.

They cannot:
- ❌ See your passwords
- ❌ Access your private browsing
- ❌ Read your personal files
- ❌ Monitor your activity

Your connection is just a relay point for accessing publicly available websites. Think of it like letting someone borrow your WiFi to check a public website — except you get paid for it.

---

## The Technical Setup: Docker

You could install Honeygain on your phone. But that kills your battery and requires your phone to stay connected.

The **pro way** is running it via Docker on a home server. Set it once, forget it forever.

### Docker Installation

Run this command on your Linux server:

```bash
docker run -d --restart=always \
  --name honeygain \
  honeygain/honeygain \
  -tou-accept \
  -email YOUR_EMAIL \
  -pass YOUR_PASSWORD \
  -device YOUR_DEVICE_NAME
```

**Replace these values:**
- `YOUR_EMAIL` — Your Honeygain account email
- `YOUR_PASSWORD` — Your Honeygain account password
- `YOUR_DEVICE_NAME` — A name for this device (e.g., "mac-mini-server")

### Verify It's Running

```bash
docker ps | grep honeygain
```

You should see the container running. Check your Honeygain dashboard — the device will appear within a few minutes.

### Auto-Restart on Boot

The `--restart=always` flag ensures Honeygain restarts automatically if your server reboots. True set-and-forget.

## Maximizing Earnings: JumpTask Mode

Honeygain offers two payout methods. Choosing the right one can boost your earnings by **10%**.

### Option 1: PayPal (Standard)

- Paid in USD
- $20 minimum payout
- Processing takes days
- Standard rates

### Option 2: JumpTask (Recommended)

- Paid in **$JMPT** tokens
- **10% bonus** on all earnings
- Instant payouts
- Lower minimum threshold

### How to Enable JumpTask

1. Go to your Honeygain dashboard
2. Click on **JumpTask Mode**
3. Connect your crypto wallet (or create one through JumpTask)
4. Toggle JumpTask mode **ON**

From now on, you earn 10% more on everything. Over a year, that adds up.

### What to Do With JMPT Tokens

Once you receive JMPT tokens, you can:

- **Hold** — Speculate on price increase
- **Swap** — Convert to stablecoins or other crypto
- **Withdraw** — Cash out through an exchange

I personally accumulate and periodically convert to stablecoins.

---

## The $5 Signup Bonus

New Honeygain users get a **$5 starter gift** when signing up with a referral link.

That's essentially a free month of earnings just for creating an account.

The bonus gets added to your account immediately. Combined with JumpTask mode, you're maximizing from day one.

---

## Realistic Expectations

Let's be pragmatic. Honeygain won't replace your salary.

**What to expect:**
- $8-15/month running 24/7
- Higher earnings in US/EU
- Steady and reliable (this app has paid consistently since 2018)

**Why it's worth it:**
- Zero effort after Docker setup
- Stacks with other apps
- The 10% JumpTask bonus compounds over time
- Free $5 to start

Free money is free money. It adds up.

## My Stack So Far

| App | Type | Status |
|-----|------|--------|
| Grass | Bandwidth | ✅ Running |
| **Honeygain** | Bandwidth | ✅ Running |
| More coming... | — | 🔜 |

Each app adds another income stream. The server runs anyway. Why not maximize it?

---

## Summary

Honeygain earned the #2 spot in my stack because:

1. **Reliable** — Paying users since 2018
2. **Docker-friendly** — Perfect for home servers
3. **JumpTask bonus** — 10% extra earnings
4. **Stackable** — Works alongside Grass and other apps

If you're already running a 24/7 server, adding Honeygain is a no-brainer.
