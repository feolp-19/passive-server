## What is Passive Income from Your Computer?

Passive income means earning money with minimal ongoing effort. With bandwidth sharing and storage rental apps, you can earn money by:

1. **Sharing your unused internet bandwidth** - Companies use it for market research, price comparison, and content delivery
2. **Renting out your extra storage** - Become part of a decentralized cloud storage network

## What You'll Need

- **Any computer** - Old laptop, desktop, Mac Mini, or even a Raspberry Pi
- **Internet connection** - The faster, the better (but even slow connections work)
- **Extra storage** (optional) - For apps like Storj

## The Apps I Recommend

Here's what I run on my Mac Mini:

### Bandwidth Sharing Apps

| App | Monthly Earnings* | Effort | My Rating |
|-----|------------------|--------|-----------|
| [Grass](/posts/grass/) | $5-20 | Set & forget | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| [Honeygain](/posts/honeygain/) | $3-15 | Set & forget | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| [EarnFM](/posts/earnfm/) | $2-10 | Set & forget | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| [Traffmonetizer](/posts/traffmonetizer/) | $2-8 | Set & forget | ⭐⭐⭐ |

*Earnings vary based on location and internet speed

### Storage Rental

| App | Monthly Earnings* | Effort | My Rating |
|-----|------------------|--------|-----------|
| [Storj](/posts/storj/) | $1-3 per TB | Setup + occasional checks | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Getting Started Steps

### Step 1: Choose Your Hardware

You don't need anything fancy:

- ✅ Old laptop or desktop
- ✅ Mini PC (like my Mac Mini)
- ✅ Raspberry Pi 4 (lower earnings but ultra low power)
- ✅ Any computer you're not using

### Step 2: Install Your OS

I recommend **Linux Mint XFCE** because:
- Lightweight (low resource usage = more for earning apps)
- Stable (runs 24/7 without issues)
- Free

### Step 3: Install the Apps

Start with one or two apps and expand from there. I recommend starting with:

1. **Grass** - Highest earnings, easiest setup
2. **Honeygain** - Most established, reliable payments

### Step 4: Let It Run

Once set up, just let your computer run! Check in weekly to make sure everything is working.

## Realistic Expectations

Let's be honest about earnings:

- **First month**: $10-30 (apps need time to ramp up)
- **After 3 months**: $30-60/month
- **With storage (Storj)**: Add $5-15/month per TB

This won't make you rich, but it's **free money** from hardware you already own!

## My Personal Results

From my Mac Mini + 4TB drive, I earn approximately:

- Grass: ~$15/month
- Honeygain: ~$10/month
- EarnFM: ~$5/month
- Traffmonetizer: ~$4/month
- Storj: ~$8/month

**Total: ~$42/month** from an old computer! 🎉
