faq:
  - question: "How much can you realistically earn from passive income apps?"
    answer: "With one server running 8 apps, I earned approximately $5-7 in cash and 30K Grass points (crypto) in my first month. Earnings grow over time as apps like Storj get vetted."
  - question: "Which passive income app pays the most?"
    answer: "Grass is the highest earner in my stack, generating 30.47K points in month 1. Honeygain comes second with $4.30 in credits."
  - question: "Is running passive income apps worth the electricity cost?"
    answer: "Yes. My Mac Mini uses about $3-5/month in electricity. Even in month 1, the earnings exceeded the power cost."
  - question: "Can you make $5000 a year from passive income apps?"
    answer: "Not from one server alone. You need multiple devices, different IP addresses, growing Storj storage, referral income, and potentially crypto token appreciation."

I set a goal: **$5,000 in passive income by December 31, 2026.**

It's been one month. My Mac Mini has been running 24/7 with 8 different apps.

Here are the real numbers. No fluff. No inflated estimates.

## The Actual Earnings

| App | Raw Earnings | Estimated USD |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| **Grass** | 30,470 points (Epoch 16) | ~$15-25* |
| **Honeygain** | 4,296 credits | ~$4.30 |
| **Storj** | $0.21 | $0.21 |
| **Pawns.app** | $0.18 | $0.18 |
| **EarnFM** | $0.169 | $0.17 |
| **Traffmonetizer** | $0.093 | $0.09 |
| **PacketStream** | $0.06 | $0.06 |
| **Repocket** | $0.04 | $0.04 |
| **Total** | — | **~$20-30** |

*\*Grass pays in points that convert to GRASS tokens (crypto). The USD value depends on the token price when you claim and sell. At current prices, 30K points is roughly $15-25.*

## Breaking It Down

### The Winners

**[Grass](/grass-passive-income-guide/)** is the clear leader. It earns more than all other apps combined. The catch is that it pays in crypto tokens, so the actual value fluctuates. But even conservatively, it's producing $15+ per month.

**[Honeygain](/honeygain-docker-setup-guide/)** came in second at $4.30. It's steady and reliable. The JumpTask crypto mode gives a 10% bonus, which I recommend enabling.

### The Middle Pack

**[Storj](/storj-node-setup-guide/)** only earned $0.21 this month, but that's expected. My node is still in the vetting phase — the network is building trust before sending real data. Storj is a slow burn. In 3-6 months, I expect this to grow significantly as my 3.3TB node fills up.

### The Small Earners

**Pawns.app**, **[EarnFM](/earnfm-docker-setup-guide/)**, **Traffmonetizer**, **PacketStream**, and **Repocket** each earned less than $0.20.

Are they worth running? Individually, no. Together, they add a few dollars per month at zero extra cost. And they're already set up — there's no reason to remove them.

## The Honest Assessment

Let's be real about where I stand:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Month 1 earnings | ~$20-30 |
| Monthly electricity cost | ~$3-5 |
| Net profit | ~$15-25 |
| **Goal** | **$5,000 by Dec 31, 2026** |
| Months remaining | 10 |
| Monthly target needed | $500/month |
| Current monthly rate | ~$25/month |

At the current rate, I'd earn about **$250 by end of year**. That's 5% of my goal.

**$5,000 from one Mac Mini is not realistic with apps alone.**

Time for a new strategy.

## The Plan to Get Closer to $5,000

Here's how I can realistically increase earnings:

### 1. Storj Growth (Potential: +$5-15/month)

My node has 3.3TB allocated but only ~180GB is used. Once fully vetted (another 1-2 months), traffic increases dramatically. A full 3TB node can earn $8-15/month.

**Action:** Keep uptime above 99.5%. Be patient.

### 2. Referral Income (Potential: +$50-200/month)

This is the real multiplier. Every person who signs up through my referral links earns me a percentage of their earnings — forever.

| App | Referral Bonus |
|-----|---------------|
| Grass | 20% of referee's points |
| Honeygain | 10% of referee's earnings |
| Pawns.app | 10% of referee's earnings |
| EarnFM | 25% of referee's earnings |
| Traffmonetizer | 5% of referee's earnings |

Even 10 active referrals could double or triple my monthly income.

**Action:** Keep publishing [guides](/tags/guide/). Drive traffic to the blog. SEO takes time but compounds.

### 3. Add More Devices (Potential: +$20-40/month)

Most bandwidth apps pay more for additional IP addresses. Running on a second device at a different location (family member's house, office) multiplies earnings.

**Action:** Set up a Raspberry Pi at another location.

### 4. Crypto Token Appreciation (Potential: Variable)

Grass and Honeygain (via JumpTask) pay in crypto. If GRASS token price doubles, my earnings double retroactively.

**Action:** Hold tokens instead of selling immediately.

### 5. Content Revenue (Potential: Unlimited)

As this blog grows, it opens doors to:
- Affiliate partnerships
- Sponsored reviews
- Display ads (once traffic exceeds 10K monthly views)

**Action:** Publish weekly. Target long-tail SEO keywords.

## Revised Projections

| Strategy | Monthly Potential | Annual Potential |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Current apps (1 server) | $25-40 | $300-480 |
| Storj fully vetted | +$10-15 | +$120-180 |
| 10 active referrals | +$30-100 | +$360-1,200 |
| Second device | +$20-40 | +$240-480 |
| Token appreciation (2x) | +$15-25 | +$180-300 |
| **Realistic total** | **$100-220** | **$1,200-2,640** |

The honest answer: **$1,200-2,600 is realistic. $5,000 requires significant referral growth or lucky crypto appreciation.**

## What I Learned in Month 1

1. **[Grass](/grass-passive-income-guide/) dominates.** It's the highest earner by far. If you only run one app, make it Grass.
2. **Stacking works.** Eight apps together earn more than any single app alone. See my [Honeygain](/honeygain-docker-setup-guide/) and [EarnFM](/earnfm-docker-setup-guide/) guides for how to set them up.
3. **Patience is required.** [Storj](/storj-node-setup-guide/), vetting, SEO — everything valuable takes months.
4. **The real money is in referrals.** App earnings from one device have a ceiling. Referrals don't.
5. **Keep your server stable.** Downtime kills Storj reputation and Grass earnings. Fix auto-mount issues, use Docker restart policies, and don't reboot unless necessary.
