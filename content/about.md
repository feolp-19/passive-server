## Hey there! 👋

I'm a tech enthusiast who discovered that my old hardware could actually **earn money while I sleep**.

### My Setup

I run an old **Mac Mini with Linux Mint XFCE** that works 24/7 generating passive income through:

- **Bandwidth sharing apps** - Grass, Honeygain, EarnFM, Traffmonetizer
- **Storage rental** - A 4TB Seagate external drive connected to Storj

### Why I Started This Blog

After getting my setup running smoothly, friends kept asking me how to do the same. So I decided to document everything here!

On this blog you'll find:

- ✅ **Step-by-step guides** for each app
- ✅ **Real earnings reports** (transparency is key!)
- ✅ **Tips & tricks** to maximize your income
- ✅ **Hardware recommendations** for beginners

### My Philosophy

- **Use what you have** - Old laptops, mini PCs, Raspberry Pis all work
- **Start small** - Even one app is better than zero passive income
- **Be patient** - This isn't get-rich-quick, it's steady extra income

### Want to Start?
